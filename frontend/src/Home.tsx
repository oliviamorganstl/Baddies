      <h2>About Joel and his podcast!</h2>

      <p>
        This is Joel, he is not only a fabulous person but an even better movie
        critic and podcasting expert. What better way to spend time folding
        laundry or driving to work than by listening to his swirling thoughts
        about entertainment and the world in general?? If ChatGPT were up right
        now I would have it write me a paragraph about how great Joel is but
        unfortunately it is at capacity so I will keep typing to make this page
        look more impressive. Joel was kind enough to volunteer his movie needs
        to his brother Spencer so that students at Brigham Young University
        could have an educational experience building him a mock website where
        he could inform his target audience about how Baconsale could transform
        their life. Baconsale is a pop culture podcast where regular episodes
        highlight relevant events that have been happening.
